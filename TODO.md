# TODO/Improvements

- Multiplayer.
  - Duels: open a room for each, and score by whoever gets the set
    first, out of 25 (or some other odd number of) 4-tuples of numbers.
    - Can we make this work with more than 2 people? It probably depends on
      the interface.
  - Facebook integration - pick a friend to challenge, redirect to a room
- Limitation modes.
  - Finish as many sets as possible in X units of time. (1 minute? 5 minutes?)
  - Finish N sets as quickly as possible. (10 sets? 20 sets?)
- UI Improvements.
  - Use cards (or something better?) instead of text for numbers.
  - Find a better way to input expressions; typing them out is cumbersome. 
    - Suggestion: drag and drop.
- More detailed statistics.
  - High scores for each 4-tuple; maybe do that thing where you enter your name
    when you get a sufficiently high score.
  - Personal high scores/streaks (Facebook login? Don't require it!).
- Replace defaults for 404, 500, etc. errors with actual pages.
- Hints.
- Accept negative and positive numbers. (Parsing is annoying for this.)
