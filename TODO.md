# TODO/Improvements

- Multiplayer - open a room for each duel, and score by whoever gets the set
  first, out of 25 (or some other odd number of) 4-tuples of numbers. Maybe
  allow challenging Facebook friends.
- Improved UI - using cards instead of text for numbers, a better way to input
  expressions
- More detailed statistics or high scores for each 4-tuple.
